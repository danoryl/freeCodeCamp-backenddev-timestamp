# Timestamp Microservice

This is my solution to the Timestamp Microservice project challenge from freeCodeCamp. More info can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice

This microservice converts a date (or timestamp) into a JSON object containing both unix timestamp and UTC time.
